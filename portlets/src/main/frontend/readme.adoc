Overview
--------

The goals of development and production builds differ greatly. In development, we want strong source mapping and a localhost server with live reloading or hot module replacement. In production, our goals shift to a focus on minified bundles, lighter weight source maps, and optimized assets to improve load time.

We will write separate webpack configurations for each environment.

We will have 3 configurtions :
* production
* development
* common


With the "common" configuration in place, we won't have to duplicate code within the environment-specific configurations.


In order to merge these configurations together, we'll use a utility called *webpack-merge*

Steps
